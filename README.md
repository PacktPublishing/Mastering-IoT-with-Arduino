## About the Video Course
In this course, you will learn to use Arduino to build IoT projects using a domain of agriculture. You will configure your Arduino and set it up for your IoT projects. You will use Actuator which is a mechanism for turning energy into motion in your device. Finally, see how to connect your Arduino to the internet wirelessly and use the MQTT protocol to interface with the ThingSpeak. By the end of the course, you will have mastered IoT using the Arduino and will be able to build your own projects.
